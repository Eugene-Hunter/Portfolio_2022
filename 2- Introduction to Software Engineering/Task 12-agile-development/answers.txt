 Reread “Agile Manifesto”. Can you think of a situation in which one or
more of the four “values” could get a software team into trouble?
Q 1 Describe agility in your own words.
	Agility is another word for swiftness, the ability to adapt almost instantly, moldable, plyable

Q 2 Why do you think requirements change so much?
	technology changes so fast, also better and improved ways of doing things, along with trends and styles, which
	influences how the market develop. The criminal factor grows by the hour, thus, to outsmart the criminal factor,
	constant updates to stay one step ahead is needed.

Q 3 Explain why test-first development helps the programmer to develop a
better understanding of the system requirements
	It gives developers a better understanding as to what the function they are on the process of creating
	is supposed to do and the type of errors that users may encounter. It also limits scope creep to a large extent
	as the focus would be on solving the problems and to not do work that is not appearing on the story board.
