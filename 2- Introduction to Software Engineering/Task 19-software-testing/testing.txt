1. Why is it not necessary for a program to be completely free of
defects before it is delivered to its customers? Explain your answer.


2.Why can testing only detect the presence of errors, not their
absence?
A program is tested to determine if it can handle any out of the ordinary
input from the users to ensure that it is able to recover from the
error with little or no impact on any of its code or data.
Validation testing is used for the purpose to show to the client that the
program meets the requirements.

3.Some people argue that developers should not be involved in
testing their own code and instead, all testing should be the
responsibility of a separate team. What are the pros and cons of
testing being carried out by the developers themselves?
Pros 



Cons


 
4.A common approach to system testing is to test the system until
the testing budget is exhausted and then deliver the system to
customers. Discuss the ethics of this approach to system testing.

This approach is completely unethical as the client is in most cases left 
with a program that does not function as intended which may lead to
company information being deleted or left in a corrupt state.
