Update anomalies:
Changing the vendor name for the vendor code 111 would mean that 3 records 
need to be updated to avoid the anomaly.


Insertion anomalies
If the product name is unknown the rest of the information cannot be entered
as the product name should match the correct product code



Deletion anomalies: 

 When deletion of a row can cause more than one set of
facts to be removed. For example, if John Hunt retires, deleting that row
causes us to lose information about the New York office.
