Write the SQL code to create a table called Student. The table structure is
summarised in the table below (Note that Stu_Num is the primary key):
	CREATE TABLE Student(
	Stu_Num char(6) NOT NULL,
	Stu_SName varchar(15) NOT NULL,
	Stu_FName varchar(15) NOT NULL,
	Stu_Initial char(1),
	Stu_StartDate DATE,
	Course_Code char(3),
	Proj_Num int,
	CONSTRAINT PK_Student PRIMARY KEY (Stu_Num)
	);
 After you have created the table in question 1, write the SQL code to enter
the first two rows of the table as below:

INSERT INTO Student
VALUES ("01", "Snow", "John", "E", "2014-04-05", "201", 6);

INSERT INTO Student
VALUES ("02", "Stark", "Arya", "C", "2017-07-12", "305", 11);

INSERT INTO Student
VALUES ("03", "Lannister", "Jamie", "C", "05-Sep-12", "101", 2);

INSERT INTO Student
VALUES ("04", "Lannister", "Cercei", "J", "05-Sep-12", "101", 2);

INSERT INTO Student
VALUES ("05", "Greyjoy", "Theon", "I", "2015-12-09", "402", 14);

INSERT INTO Student
VALUES ("06", "Tyrell", "Margaery", "Y", "2017-07-12", "305", 10);

INSERT INTO Student
VALUES ("07", "Baratheon", "Tommen", "R", "2019-06-13", "201", 5);


Assuming all the data in the Student table has been entered as shown
below, write the SQL code that will list all attributes for a Course_Code
of 305.

SELECT * 
FROM Student
WHERE Course_Code = "305";

 Write the SQL code to change the course code to 304 for the person
whose student number is 07.

UPDATE Student
SET Course_Code = "304"
WHERE Stu_Num = "07";

 Write the SQL code to delete the row of the person named Jamie
Lannister, who started on 5 September 2012, whose course code is 101 and
project number is 2. Use logical operators to include all of the information
given in this problem.

DELETE FROM Student
WHERE Stu_SName = "Lannister" 
AND Stu_FName = "Jamie" 
AND Stu_StartDate = 5/9/12
AND Proj_Num = 2;

Write the SQL code that will change the Proj_Num to 14 for all those
students who started before 1 January 2016 and whose course code is at
least 201
UPDATE Student
Set Proj_Num = 14
WHERE Stu_StartDate <= "2016-01-01" 
AND Course_Code >= "201";

Write the SQL code that will delete all of the data inside a table, but not
the table itself.

TRUNCATE TABLE Student;

Write the SQL code that will delete the Student table entirely.

DROP TABLE STUDENT;
