I
Briefly describe possible standards that might be used for these real-world
products:
1.Soap - Quality, Efficiency, Fragrance, Safety
2.Aeroplane - Reliability, Safety
3.Curry - Quality, Safety

II
Explain why a high-quality software process should lead to high-quality
software products. Discuss possible problems with this system of quality
management.
A high-quality software process takes as many of the software quality standards into account as possible.
It becomes time-consuming and costly to address all the problems and a QM team is needed to limit and focus
on the problems based on severity of the problems.


III
Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for
discovering errors in a program. What types of errors are unlikely to be
discovered through inspections?
It provides a second/third  quality check of the code for common errors or problems. Other anomalies can
also be detected. It will not be able to discover logical errors as logical errors are based on calculation
formulas created in the minds of humans and is not able to predict what the calculations are to be used for.

IV
Why is it difficult to validate the relationships between internal product
attributes and external attributes?
It is difficult to validate the relationships as the validations are based on the user's or developer's
experience with the product.
