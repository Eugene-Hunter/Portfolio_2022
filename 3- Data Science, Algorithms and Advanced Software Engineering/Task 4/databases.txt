Look up “transaction consistency”. Describe it in your own words.
+ Transaction consistency guarantees that all in-scope operations of the target database will be regarded as to have been committed in the instance where 
  only a part of the transaction has been committed. All the read locks that are active will remain active until the transaction is completed. This provides a
  consistent view of the database and is the highest isolation level that guarantees that the transaction has a consistent view of the database.
