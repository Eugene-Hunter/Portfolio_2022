# ● Create a dictionary called countryMap, where the KEYS are the name of a
#country (i.e. a string), and the VALUE for each key is the name of that
#country's capital city.
#○ For example:
#countryMap = {
#'UnitedKingdom': 'London',
#'Sweden': 'Stockholm'Canada': 'Ottawa',}
#● What does print(countryMap['Sweden']) return?

countryMap = {"United Kingdom" : "London", "Sweden" : "Stockholm", "Canada" : "Ottawa"}

print(countryMap["Sweden"])
