You are asked to print out all the numbers from 1 to 1000. Write 2 lines of
code in your file to print out all numbers from 1 to 1000
Once you've got this to work, add logic inside your loop to only print out
the numbers from 1 to 1000 that are even (i.e. divisible by 2). Remember
the modulo command â€” i.e., %. 10%5 will give you the remainder of 10
divided by 5. 10 divided by 5 equals 2 with a remainder of 0.
